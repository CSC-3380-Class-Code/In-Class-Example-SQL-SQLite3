## Downloading SQLite

To begin, make sure you have SQLite downloaded and working.
The following guides are here for help:
- https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/ {Windows}
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CAspm7YwTU {Mac and Windows}

Once downloaded you can begin working with the examples here. To test
to make sure everything is working properly, run `dotnet run` in the
terminal within the "Queries" folder.

If that works, feel free to play around writing queries and seeing the
output of the other queries in `Database/ExampleQuesries.sql` file
